<h3>Aims</h3>
This exercise aims to give you practice with using the Unix shell
for processing collections of files, and in using Unix filters for
performing analyses of files.

<h3>Assessment</h3>
<table border="0" cellpadding="3">
<tbody><tr><td><b>Submission:</b></td><td><code>give cs2041 lab02 lab02.txt</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Deadline:</b></td><td>either during the lab, or Monday 8 August 11:59pm (midnight)</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Assessment:</b></td><td>
Make sure that you are familiar with the
<a href="http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2041cgi/16s2/lab/assessment.html">lab assessment criteria</a>.
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h3>Tasks</h3>
These week's questions mostly require you to find a shell command or pipeline to solve the task.
<p>
As you go through the lab, after you determine the answer
copy the pipeline and its output into a file named <code>lab02.txt</code>.
Use this <a href="http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2041cgi/16s2/lab/lab02.txt">template</a>.
Note that this lab page contains hints that the template does not, so keep this page open.
</p><p>
After your tutor has checked your work, submit this file
using the command <code>give cs2041 lab02 lab02.txt</code>.

</p><ol>
<h3>Searching a Dictionary with <code>Less</code></h3>
On most Unix systems you will find one or more dictionaries containing many thousands of
words usually in the directories.<code>/usr/share/dict/</code> or <code>/usr/dict/</code>.
<p>
We copied <a href="http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2041cgi/16s2/lab/sh/dictionary/words.txt">one such dictionary</a> for this lab exercise.
To save repeatedly typing its full pathname for these exercises,
make a symbolic link to the file with this command:

</p><pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">ln -s ~cs2041/public_html/lab/sh/dictionary/words.txt</kbd>
</pre>

(this creates a link to the file in the current directory pointing to
the original file, without taking up the space of a complete copy)
<p></p><p>
The preferred viewer for (potentially very long) text files is <code>less</code>,
whose name is a lame pun on that of its predecessor, <code>more</code>.
<code>less</code> has regular expression search capabilities.
</p><p>
Within <code>less</code>:
</p><ul>
<li> the space bar advances a page at a time
</li><li> <b>b</b> goes back a page
</li><li> a <i>number</i> followed by <code>G</code> goes to that line (e.g. <code>50G</code> goes to line 50)
</li><li> <code>G</code> by itself goes to the end of the file
</li><li> slash (/) followed by a <i>regexp</i> finds the next instance
    of the <i>regexp</i> in the file (there is no terminating slash)
</li><li> question-mark (?) followed by a <i>regexp</i> finds the previous
    instance of the <i>regexp</i> in the file (no terminating '?')
</li></ul>
<p></p><p>
For regular-expression searching, make sure that you understand where
<code>less</code> leaves the matching line on the screen.
</p>
<p>
Access the dictionary via the command

</p><pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">less words.txt</kbd>
</pre>
<ol type="a">
<li>
How do you use <code>less</code> to find  word is on line 2000 (it's at the top of the page)?

<pre class="answer">Less keystrokes: <code>2000G</code>

</li></ol>
<h3>Applying  Unix Tools to a Dictionary</h3>


Write shell pipelines using <code>egrep</code>, <code>cat</code> and <code>wc</code> which answer the following
questions.
<p></p><p>
Provide both the command/pipeline and its output.

</p><ol type="a">
<li>
How many total words does the file <code>words.txt</code> contain?

<div class="answer">
<pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">wc -w words.txt
</kbd><samp>390582 words.txt
</samp></pre>
</div>
</li><li>

Note that some of these words are derivates of other words
(e.g. "Aberdeen" and "Aberdeen's"). Maybe these shouldn't be
included in the word count. How many total words, excluding
those ending in "'s", are there in the dictionary?

<div class="answer">
<pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">egrep -v "'s$" words.txt | wc -w
</kbd><samp>299845
</samp></pre>
</div>
</li><li>
How could you use <code>cat -n</code> and <code>egrep</code>
to find out which word is on line 100000? &nbsp; (you'll need to check the
exact output format of <code>cat -n</code>)

<div class="answer">
<pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">cat -n words.txt | egrep '^100000'
</kbd><samp>100000	adviser
</samp></pre>

Not that each line coming out
of the <code>cat</code> starts with some spaces, followed by a number,
followed by a TAB character. You can explicitly match the TAB if you
want, but you'll need to type control-V followed by TAB in order to
get a TAB to appear in the command line.n line 100000
</div>
</li><li>
How could you use <code>cat -n</code> and <code>egrep</code>
to print the 700th line, and no other lines? &nbsp; (you'll need to check the
exact output format of <code>cat -n</code>)

<div class="answer">
<pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">cat -n words.txt | egrep '^ *700[^0-9]'
</kbd><samp>   700	Adirondack
</samp></pre>

Note: \s may not work in CSE labs. cat -n words.txt | egrep '[[:space:]]700[[:space:]]' is another solution to replace \s.
</div>
</li><li>
How do you use <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code>
to find out what word is on line 200000

<div class="answer">
<pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">head -200000 words.txt | tail -1
</kbd><samp>geodynamics's
</samp></pre>
</div>
</li></ol>
<h3>Finding Unusual Words With Regular Expressions</h3>

Now consider how we might locate various "unusual" words in the dictionary
using <code>egrep</code>:

<ol type="a">
<li> which words contain the characters "lmn" consecutively?

<div class="answer">
<pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">egrep 'lmn' words.txt
</kbd><samp>Selmner
Selmner's
almner
almners
calmness
calmness's
calmnesses
</samp></pre>
</div>
</li><li> how many words contain "zz", but do not end in apostrophe-s ('s)?

<div class="answer">
<pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">egrep 'zz' words.txt | egrep -v "'s$"|wc -w
</kbd><samp>628
</samp></pre>
or

<pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">egrep 'zz' words.txt | egrep -c -v "'s$"
</kbd><samp>628
</samp></pre>
</div>
</li><li> how many words contain four consecutive vowels?

<div class="answer">
<pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">egrep '[aeiou][aeiou][aeiou][aeiou]' words.txt|wc
</kbd><samp>    205     205    2296
</samp></pre>
or

<pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">egrep -c '[aeiou]{4}' words.txt
</kbd><samp>205
</samp></pre>
or ignoring case:
<br>
<pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">egrep '[aeiouAEIOU][aeiouAEIOU][aeiouAEIOU][aeiouAEIOU]' words.txt|wc
</kbd><samp>    207     207    2308
</samp></pre>
or

<pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">egrep -ic '[aeiou]{4}' words.txt
</kbd><samp>207
</samp></pre>
</div>
</li><li> which English words contain all 5 english vowels "aeiou" in that order?
<p>
Note, the word may contain more than 5 vowels but it must contain aeiou in that order. e.g. ub<b>a</b>isda<b>e</b>ucx<b>io</b>fgde<b>u</b>sc

</p><div class="answer">

</kbd><samp>abstemious

</samp></pre>
</div>
</li><li>Still on words, we want to know how many words have another
9-letter dictionary word embedded in them.
<p>
Place all the 9-letter words in the dictionary in a file called <code>words9.txt</code>.
How to do this? Use a egrep pattern anchored at both ends,
that matches 9 letters.
</p><p>
Don't include words which contain upper case characters.
</p><p>
Don't include words which contain any non-letter in them,
We don't want to clude words such as <code>Bernouilli's</code>).
</p><p>
Redirect the output of the command using the &gt; shell notation.
How many of these words are there?
</p><p>
Now we want to use the list of words as a (huge) search pattern.
<code>fgrep</code> uses a highly optimised algorithm to do this.
Its usage is
</p><pre>fgrep -f <i>WordsToFind FilesToSearch...</i>
</pre>
e.g.
<pre>fgrep -f words9.txt words.txt
</pre>
<p></p><p>
Devise a pipeline that uses your word list (<code>words9.txt</code>)
and <code>words.txt</code> to count the number of words that have a 9-letter word as a substring.
For example "luminesce" is a substring of "photoluminescence".
</p><p>
Again we don't want to match words that contain upper-case letters or non-letters.
</p><p>
In other words how many 10+ letter lower case words which contain a 9 character lower-case word.

</p><p>
Note there are a small number of  non-English words in the dictionary which
have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic">diacritical marks</a>
which are encoded as a separate character in ASCII - your regular
expressions don't need to handle these correctly.

</p><div class="answer">
<pre># Create the words9.txt file
# Note that this ignores words ending in 's
egrep '^[a-z]{9}$' words.txt &gt; words9.txt
# Get the words containg these as a substring
# First stage: extract all words that contain a "words9.txt" word as a
#              substring or are equal to a "words9.txt" word
# Second stage: eliminate all nine-character words (i.e. drop all
#              of the extracted words that come from the "words9.txt" file)
fgrep -f words9.txt words.txt | egrep -iv '^[a-z]{9}$'
</pre>
<pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">fgrep -f words9.txt words.txt |egrep -v '[^a-z]'|egrep '[a-z]{10}'|wc -w

<h3>Counting Classes</h3>
The file <a href="http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2041cgi/16s2/lab/sh/enrollments/classes.txt">/home/cs2041/public_html/lab/sh/enrollments/classes.txt</a> contains a
list of all CSE tute/lab classes downloaded from MyUNSW.

<ol type="a">
<li>
How many total classes are there?

<div class="answer">
Each line in the file represents a class. Therefore, the number
of classes is equal to the number of lines in the file.

<p></p></div>
</li><li>
Write a pipeline to print how many different courses have classes?
Hint: <code>cut</code> with the <code>-f</code> option will be useful here.
Hint: the output of the pipeline should be:


<pre class="command_line"><samp>36
</samp></pre>
<div class="answer">
Approach: extract just the course codes, then sort them into groups
of identical course codes, then compress each group to size one,
giving one line for each group (i.e. each course). Then count the
number of lines.


<pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">cut -f1 classes.txt | sort | uniq | wc -l

</li><li>
Write a pipeline which will print the course with the most classes (and no
other courses) and how many classes are in this course? Hint: the output of the pipeline should be:

Write a pipeline that prints the most frequently-used tut room and how often it is used?
Note you have to include tut-labs. In otherwords TLB as well as TUT. Hint: the output of the pipeline should be:


<pre class="command_line"><samp>     13 Quad G041
</samp></pre>
<div class="answer">
Approach: extract the tutes and tut-labs, cut out the room names, then sort them into groups,
then count the number of entries in each group, then sort numerically
and grab the last line.
<p>
</p><pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">egrep 'TUT|TLB' classes.txt|cut -f5|sort|uniq -c|sort |tail -1
</kbd><samp>     13 Quad G041
</samp></pre>
<p></p><p>
The last two steps in the above pipelines could be changed
to <code>sort -nr | head -1</code>
</p></div>
</li><li>
Write a pipeline  that prints the most popular time-of-day for tuts (make sure you include tut-labs) and how many tut-labs are at that time?
Hint <code>cut</code> has a <code>-c</code> option. Hint: the output of the pipeline should be:


<pre class="command_line"><samp>     25 12-13
</samp></pre>
<div class="answer">
<p>
</p><pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell"> egrep 'TUT|TLB' classes.txt|cut -f4|cut -c 5-9|sort|uniq -c|sort -n|tail -1

Write a pipeline to discover
which COMP courses run the most simultaneous
classes of the same type? (e.g. three tutes at the same
time on the same day).
This one might take a little thought,
but remember that this time we're looking for whether
something is duplicated or not, rather than counting
unique occurrences of something.

<div class="answer">
This question needs a little interpretation. The idea is that we're
interested in any course where two classes are running on the same
day at the same time. The info we want is contained in fields 1, 3
and 4 of each line. If we cut these lines out, then sort the file,
then count the size of each group, we could extract the final result
by picking out groups whose size was different to '1'. The following
pipeline uses this approach:
<p>
</p><pre class="command_line"><kbd class="shell">egrep '^COMP' classes.txt | cut -f1,3,4|sort|uniq -c|sort|tail
</kbd><samp>      2 COMP9311	LAB	Wed 19-21

Challenge: write a pipeline that prints list of the course names (only) of COMP courses that
run 2 or more simultaneous classes of the same type? (e.g. three tutes at the same

<h3>Challenge: Interesting Regexps</h3>
Use <code>egrep</code> to test your answers to these questions.
<p>
Try to solve these questions using the standard regular expression language described
in lectures.
</p><p>
</p><ol type="a">
<li>
Write a regular expression for egrep that matches any line containing
at least one <code>A</code> and at least one <code>B</code>.
For example:
<p>
</p><table border="1">
<tbody><tr><th width="50%">Matching</th><th width="50%">Not Matching
</th></tr><tr><td>Andrew's favourite Band is not</td><td>George is Brillant
</td></tr><tr><td>ABBA</td><td>Andrew
</td></tr><tr><td>BA</td><td>B
</td></tr><tr><td>AB</td><td>A
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p></p><p>
So to test with egrep you might do this:
</p><p>
</p><pre>% cat &gt;file1 &lt;&lt;eof
Andrew's favourite Band is not
George is Brillant
ABBA
Andrew
AB
BA
A
B
eof
% egrep 'REGEXP' &lt;file1
Andrew's favourite Band is not
ABBA
AB
BA
</pre>
<p></p><p>
</p><div class="answer">
<pre>A.*B|B.*A
</pre>
</div>
<p></p></li><li>
Write a regular expression  for egrep that matches any line containing
only the characters <code>A</code> and  <code>B</code> such that
all pairs of adjacent A's occur before any pairs of adjacent B's.
In other words if there is pair of B's on the line , there can not be
a pair of A's afterwards.
<p>
</p><table border="1">
<tbody><tr><th width="50%">Matching</th><th width="50%">Not Matching
</th></tr><tr><td>ABAABAABAABBBBABB</td><td>BBAA
</td></tr><tr><td>ABBA</td><td>ABBAA
</td></tr><tr><td>ABAAAAAAAAAABBA</td><td>ABBABABABABAA
</td></tr><tr><td>ABABABABA</td><td>ABBBAAA
</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>BBABABABABABABAA
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p></p><p>
</p><div class="answer">
<pre>^(BA|A)*(|B)(AB|B)*(|A)$
</pre>
<p>
or courtesy Squish:
</p><p>
</p><pre>^(BA|A)*(BA|B)*$
</pre>
<p></p></div>
<p></p></li><li>
Write a regular expression  for egrep that matches any line containing
only the characters <code>A</code> and  <code>B</code> such that
the number of A's is divisible by 4.
<p>
</p><table border="1">
<tbody><tr><th width="50%">Matching</th><th width="50%">Not Matching
</th></tr><tr><td>AAAA</td><td>AAAAA
</td></tr><tr><td>BABABABAB</td><td>ABABBBBBBBBBBBBBBBAAA
</td></tr><tr><td>AAAABBBBAAAA</td><td>AAAABBABBAAAA
</td></tr><tr><td>BBBAABBBBBAABBBAAAA</td><td>BBBAABBABBBAABBBAAAA
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p></p><p>
</p><div class="answer">
<pre>^B*(AB*AB*AB*AB*)*$
</pre>
</div>
<p></p></li><li>
Write a regular expression for egrep  that matches any line containing
only the characters <code>A</code> and  <code>B</code> such that
there are exactly <i>n</i> A's followed by
exactly <i>n</i> B's and no other characters.
<p>
</p><table border="1">
<tbody><tr><th width="50%">Matching</th><th width="50%">Not Matching
</th></tr><tr><td>AAABBB</td><td>AAABB
</td></tr><tr><td>AB</td><td>BA
</td></tr><tr><td>AABB</td><td>AABBB
</td></tr><tr><td>AAAABBBB</td><td>AAAABBBBA
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p></p><p>
If you can't invent a regular expression, can you write a shell script using egrep, sed and test, if &amp; while
which performs the same task.

</p><div class="answer">
This can't be done with a (true) regular expression.
You prove this via the the wonderfully named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumping_lemma_for_regular_languages">pumping lemma</a>.
<p>
It is possible <a href="http://faq.perl.org/perlfaq6.html#Can_I_use_Perl_regulextension">with extensions to the regular expression language provided in languages such as Perl </a>.
</p><p>
Shell script which prints line containing n As followed by n Bs&lt;


</p><pre class="program">#!/bin/sh
while read line
do
    string="$line"
    while test -n "`echo "$string"|egrep '^A.*B$'`"
    do
        string=`echo "$string"|sed 's/^A//'`
        string=`echo "$string"|sed 's/B$//'`
    done
    test -z "$string" &amp;&amp; echo "$line"
done</pre>

Here is a clever solution, courtesy Alexis Shaw, using grep, and some features of sed we don't cover:
<p></p><p>
Grep &amp; sed script which prints line containing n As followed by n Bs


</p><pre class="program">#!/bin/sh
# written by Alexis Shaw
egrep "^A*B*$"|
sed "s/\(A*\)\(B*\)/\1|\2/;s/B/A/g"|
sed -n "s/^\(A*\)|\1$/\1|\1/p"|
sed -n "s/^\(A*\)|\(A*\)$/\1\n|\1/gp"|
sed "/|/ s/A/B/g"|
sed "N; s/\n|//"
</pre>

Here is more sed-ish solution, these sed feature aren't covered in the course and
languages such as Perl &amp; Python are generally used instead these days:
<p></p><p>
Sed script which prints line containing n As followed by n Bs


</p><pre class="program">#!/bin/sh
sed '
    /^A*B*$/!d
    h
    s/\(B*\)$/C\1/
    s/B/A/g
    /^\(A*\)C\1$/!d
    g
'
