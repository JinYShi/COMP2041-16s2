<h1>Bulls'n'Cows Guessing Game</h1>Welcome to the Bulls and Cows guessing game. <p>
There are four colours "hidden" under the squares. </p><p>
</p><table border="1" cellpadding="10">
<tbody><tr>
  <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
  <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
  <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
  <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table> <p>
In each turn you can guess colours for as many squares as you like. <br>
I will then tell you how many "bulls" and "cows" you scored. <br>
A "bull" means that you guessed the correct colour in the correct square. <br>
A "cow" means that you guessed the correct colour but in the wrong square. <br>
Each guess will be counted only once, and bulls are counted before cows. </p><p>
The aim of the game is for you to work out the colours <br>
in the least number of guesses.
